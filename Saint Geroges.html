        <span>Saint Goerges Church:</span> <br />
        Known as the Maronite Church of Saint George. It is a church that rises
        around 900 meters above sea level, and is distinguished by its wonderful
        beauty and large size, as it holds the first place in terms of the
        largest monastery and church of Saint George in the Batroun district. It
        is ranked among the first places as the most beautiful altars and
        archaeological sites in Batroun and Lebanon. It is located on the hills
        of the village and has the oldest picture of Saint George, as it is more
        than 400 years old. It is the only church in Lebanon that has a picture
        of Saint George with his head facing left. Saint George is the patron
        saint of the parish, whom all the villagers respect and fear.
        <br /><br />
        <span>Its History:</span> <br />
        The church was founded as a "large chapel" more than 500 years ago, and
        then transformed into what it is today thanks to the villagers and the
        parish priest, may God have mercy on him, Boulos Badran. Before reading
        the Gospel on Sunday, every person present in the church would head to
        the Lady of "Hidak Al-Qate'a", known today as the Lady of the Alaa,
        carrying rocks and bringing them to build the Church of Saint George.
        The columns next to the cathedral are what remains of the Mamluk
        Citadel, where the church now stands.
        <br /><br />
        <span>Among the wonders of Saint George the Martyr:</span> <br />

        Protecting the village from the Turkish soldiers who wanted to occupy
        it, as he made the soldiers lose their way between the villages and
        caused a strong wind storm, preventing them from knowing that they were
        in Asia.
        <br />
        Protecting the village from deterrence and the Palestinians who wanted
        to occupy the village, but they passed through the entire village and
        went to the neighboring village without knowing that they were passing
        through Asia.
        <br />
        Protecting the village from several diseases and epidemics.

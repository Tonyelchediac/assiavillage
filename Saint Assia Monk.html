        <span>Saint Assia Monk:</span> <br />
        <span>Its History:</span> <br />
        It is a monastery built during the days of the Roman Empire, and a monk
        lived in it who was the doctor of the region and it is said that he is
        Saint Assia, so the village was named after it. The monastery was a very
        large and tall building, but over time it was destroyed due to natural
        factors and its "age" and the villagers took its stones to build their
        homes and to build the town church, and some of the graves, and there is
        still a wall of the monastery that is on the eastern side, and the
        entrance to the monastery which is a masterpiece of ancient construction
        that is distinguished by its beauty, especially from above.
        <br /><br />
        <span>Among the Saint Assia Monk:</span> <br />
        There is also a place next to the monastery called “Mar Asiya’s
        Treasury”, and it is said that it is a place filled with gold beyond
        imagination. These huge amounts of gold go back to the people of the
        kingdom who lived in the castle that was the site of the Church of Mar
        Gerges, reaching the monastery in a very large size, as it is said “If
        they were loading the gold on camels and a lame camel came from the
        Levant, there would still be quantities of gold for them to carry and go
        with.”

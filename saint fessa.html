        <span>Saint Fessa:</span> <br />
        Fessa was in the city of Raha between the two rivers. She had three
        children, Taugnes, Agapius, and Vidala. She raised them in the faith of
        Christ. The governor of Edessa ordered her to be arrested, and he began
        to flatter her and her children to sacrifice to idols and abandon the
        Christian religion. The saint did not obey his order. She did not waver
        in her love for Christ. The governor ordered her children to be tortured
        first. They inflicted torture on them before her eyes until they died,
        and she encouraged them to endure the torture for the sake of Christ the
        Divine Redeemer. Then the governor ordered her to be imprisoned after
        they had made her taste various types of torture, while she remained
        steadfast in her faith. Finally, they brought her to Macedonia, where
        they cut off her head, and she received the crown of martyrdom in the
        late fourth century.

        <span>Its History:</span> <br />
        She is the Iraqi Saint Fassa, she only has two churches in the whole
        world, a church in Iraq, and Our Lady of Fassa in Lebanon - Assia. Since
        ancient times, Fassa was a village and one of the richest areas in the
        world known as the Kingdom of Fassa, as all its inhabitants were from
        the upper velvet class (they ate from golden plates and spoons and ...),
        but they left their homes and buried all the gold they used and its
        inhabitants migrated to the island of Cyprus. Over time, the houses were
        demolished and became rubble due to natural factors and the migration of
        its inhabitants, knowing that at the present time there are families in
        Cyprus that belong to the lineage of the families of the Kingdom of
        Fassa, and they are currently talking about the kingdom and the life of
        their ancestors in it. And now life has returned to it and it has become
        like in the past and the Church of Our Lady of Fassa was built in it in
        2003 and it is now a scouting area, one of the most important scouting
        and tourist areas in Lebanon.
